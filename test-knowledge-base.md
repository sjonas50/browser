# Test Knowledge Base Document

This is a test document for the AI Browser's knowledge base system.

## Quantum Computing Basics

Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that leverages quantum mechanical phenomena to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or "qubits" which can exist in superposition states.

### Key Concepts:
- **Superposition**: Qubits can be in multiple states simultaneously
- **Entanglement**: Quantum particles can be correlated in ways that classical particles cannot
- **Quantum Interference**: Amplifies correct answers and cancels out wrong ones

## The AI Browser Project

The AI Browser is an innovative web browser that integrates artificial intelligence capabilities directly into the browsing experience. It features:

1. **Smart Search**: AI-powered search that understands context and intent
2. **Knowledge Base**: Personal knowledge management system with vector search
3. **Page Analysis**: AI can summarize and analyze web content
4. **RAG Integration**: Retrieval Augmented Generation for enhanced responses

## Testing the Integration

When you search for "quantum computing" or "AI Browser features", this document should appear in your search results, demonstrating that the knowledge base is properly integrated with the search functionality.

The system uses:
- Vectra for local vector storage
- Transformers.js for generating embeddings
- All-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for semantic search
