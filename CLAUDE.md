## Technical Stack
- **Runtime**: Electron (Chrome + Node.js)
- **Languages**: JavaScript (with TypeScript configuration ready)
- **AI**: Claude 4 Opus API (claude-opus-4-20250514) via Anthropic
- **Knowledge Base**: Custom vector store with RAG capabilities
- **Security**: Local browser isolation, CSP, request filtering
- **Storage**: Encrypted local storage with electron-store
- **UI**: HTML5, CSS3 with dark theme, multiple sidebars
- **Logging**: Winston for comprehensive debugging

## Key Components Implemented
1. **Main Process** (src/main.js) - Electron app initialization with security controls
2. **Preload Script** (src/preload.js) - Secure API exposure to renderer
3. **AIManager** (src/ai/AIManager.js) - AI orchestration with RAG capabilities
4. **ClaudeHandler** (src/ai/claude-handler.js) - Claude API integration
5. **KnowledgeBaseManager** (src/ai/KnowledgeBaseManager.js) - Personal knowledge system
6. **VectorStore** (src/storage/VectorStore.js) - Vector similarity search
7. **StorageManager** (src/storage/StorageManager.js) - Encrypted data storage
8. **SecurityManager** (src/security/SecurityManager.js) - Request filtering and CSP
9. **Renderer** (src/ui/renderer.js) - UI interaction and browser functionality
10. **AI Browser Assistant** (src/ui/ai-browser-assistant.js) - Deep search functionality
11. **AI Sidebar Handler** (src/ui/ai-sidebar-handler.js) - Chat interface
12. **Knowledge Base Handler** (src/ui/knowledge-base-handler.js) - Knowledge UI

## Commands to Run
- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linter
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `node test-knowledge-base.js` - Test knowledge base functionality

## Environment Setup
1. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment variables
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the browser

## Recent Accomplishments ðŸŽ‰

### Knowledge Base System
- Created a complete personal knowledge base system with:
  - Document storage and management
  - Vector-based semantic search
  - Collection organization
  - Session vs permanent storage options
  - Full UI with sidebar interface
  
### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Integrated knowledge base with AI queries
- Three modes: Augment, Priority, Only
- Context enhancement for Claude API calls
- Knowledge source tracking

### Architecture Improvements
- Clean separation between backend and frontend
- IPC communication for all knowledge base operations
- Proper error handling and logging throughout
- Modular component design

## Next Steps
1. Test the browser functionality by running `npm run dev`
2. Test knowledge base with `node test-knowledge-base.js`
3. Implement security layer for knowledge base
4. Optimize vector search performance
5. Add ChromaDB integration for better scalability

## Notes
- Using Claude 4 Opus (claude-opus-4-20250514) for all AI functionality
- Knowledge base is fully local - no external dependencies
- Vector store is currently in-memory with file persistence
- Ready for ChromaDB integration when needed
- Branded as "Powered by The Attic AI"
